In this folder we conduct an analysis of S&P500 stocks using unsupervised methods.
First, stock returns are computed. Then KMeans clustering and embedding with an autoencoder.
Visualization on clustering and embeddings are performed to analyse similarities between stocks.
The code is available into the notebooks sub folder.
